                            <h3>What is Reiki</h3>
                            <h5 class="mt-3 mb-3 dom-tc">Continued..</h5>
                           
                            <p>A treatment feels like a wonderful glowing radiance that flows through and around you. Reiki treats the whole person including body, emotions, mind and spirit creating many beneficial effects that include relaxation and feelings of peace, security and wellbeing. Many have reported miraculous results.</p>
                            <p>Reiki is a simple, natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement that everyone can use. It has been effective in helping virtually every known illness and malady and always creates a beneficial effect. It also works in conjunction with all other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery.</p>
                            <p>An amazingly simple technique to learn, the ability to use Reiki is not taught in the usual sense, but is transferred to the student during a Reiki class. This ability is passed on during an "attunement" given by a Reiki master and allows the student to tap into an unlimited supply of "life force energy" to improve one's health and enhance the quality of life.</p>
                            <p>Reiki is a Japanese form of energy work that cleanses and balances the energy system in the body. As a result, the body’s natural self-healing mechanisms strengthen, helping to establish optimum health.</p>
                            <p>During a session, the Reiki healer works directly with your energy field to remove blockages, detoxify your system, and restore your vital life force energy. Reiki utilises a gentle laying on of hands to conduct the necessary energy force between the practitioner and receiver. The benefits of Reiki range from the release of habitual mental/emotional stress to alleviating chronic pain.</p>
                            <p>While Reiki is spiritual in nature, it is not a religion. It has no dogma, and there is nothing you must believe in order to learn and use Reiki. In fact, Reiki is not dependent on belief at all and will work whether you believe in it or not. Because Reiki comes from God, many people find that using Reiki puts them more in touch with the experience of their religion rather than having only an intellectual concept of it.</p>
                            <p>While Reiki is not a religion, it is still important to live and act in a way that promotes harmony with others. Mikao Usui, the founder of the Reiki system of natural healing, recommended that one practice certain simple ethical ideals to promote peace and harmony, which are nearly universal across all cultures.</p> <p>The word Reiki is made of two Japanese words - Rei which means "God's Wisdom or the Higher Power" and Ki which is "life force energy". So Reiki is actually "spiritually guided life force energy."</p>

                            <h3>What is Theta Healing</h3>
                            <h5 class="mt-3 mb-3"> Continued..</h5>
                            <p>Theta Healing is the term used to describe an alternative therapy based on a healing technique that allows you to reach a level of consciousness which lets you to instantly change your emotional, mental, spiritual or physical reality.</p>
                            <p>The method works by addressing the cause of blockages that may arise in the way you function - blockages caused by factors such as emotional repression, belief systems, fears and traumas. It's believed that when these blockages occur, the flow of spiritual energy in the body is restricted. Theta healing enables you to identify these restrictions and to connect to a higher source in order to help you release negative beliefs. The technique is used to treat a variety of issues from emotional issues such as helping to heal relationship traumas, to aiding people recover from physical injury.</p>
                            <h5 class="mt-3 mb-3">History of Theta healing</h5>
                            <p>Theta healing was developed in the 1990s by Vianna Stibal, a naturopath, massage therapist and intuitive reader who claims to have healed herself from a life-threatening cancer. Since then she has used her technique to heal clients from her own practice in the USA and has trained other practitioners around the world.</p>
                            <h5 class="mt-3 mb-3">How Theta healing works</h5>
                            <p>Practitioners of Theta Healing focus on the state of 'theta' level of brainwave activity, a state of very deep relaxation that occurs within the brain when we dream and the frequency of the subconscious mind. They believe that your subconscious beliefs - shaped by the people in your life, your culture and your experiences - shape your health and behaviour. Positive beliefs help you move forward while negative ones hold you back. Theta Healing taps into this subconscious level and empowers you to remove and replace negative emotions, feelings and thoughts with positive ones. Harnessing the power of the theta state enables you access your subconscious so you can instantly reprogram those negative subconscious beliefs in order to create optimal health.</p>
                            <p>Theta healing has been described as the practical application of quantum mechanics. The idea is that our receptor cells in our bodies have a certain vibration. At the same neuropeptides (intercellular messengers), also have a specific vibration. When a neuropeptides interacts with a receptor cell that vibrates at the same frequency, they are able to connect. To help facilitate this flow in our bodies, Theta Healing works on changing the vibration, or 'energy' of the receptor cells. According to quantum physics everything is made up of energy so Theta Healing operates on the premise that since we are made up of energy, we can use energy to change ourselves for the better.</p>
                            <h5 class="mt-3 mb-3">Theta healing my be used to help treat problems including:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Stress, trauma and depression.</li>
                                <li>Fears and phobias</li>
                                <li>Negative relationship or family issues</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="pt-2">It is also thought to help manifest abundance, prosperity, personal growth and success.</p>
                            <p class="text-italic">Theta Healing is not meant to replace medical advice but instead is best worked hand in hand with it.</p>
                            <h5 class="mt-3 mb-3">What to Expect</h5>
                            <p>During a basic session of Theta therapy, a practitioner will use muscle testing (a technique of kinesiology) to identify limiting subconscious beliefs. They will then enter a Theta state in order to identify the areas in your body that need to change. During this process you will work with the healer to reveal any negative beliefs and give your permission to let the practitioner reprogram the cells that need to change in order to facilitate healing.</p>

                            <h3>What is Kahuna Massage</h3>
                            <h5 class="mt-3 mb-3"> Continued..</h5>
                            <p>Kahuna Massage (often referred to as Ka Huna Body Work) is a therapeutic massage technique based on the teachings of the ancient Hawaiian Kahunas. A Kahuna is a master of esoteric wisdom applied to a specific field like herbalism or shamanism. HU and NA: The power of movement (chaos, change) which is HU and the power of stillness (order & form) is NA. Huna is the philosophy behind the ancient Hawaiian temple style bodywork known as Ka Huna Bodywork or Lomi Lomi which literally means “to massage”. 
                            <p>It’s a sacred and beautiful style of healing which aims to integrate the your physical, emotional and spiritual aspects into balance and harmony. It’s a very vigorous and rhythmic style of massage which creates a deeply relaxed feeling within you, <h5 class="mt-3 mb-3">Kahuna Body work is a holistic natural therapy</h5> designed to bring healing to your body, mind and spirit.</p>
                            <p>Bec, your practitioner is totally focused on you with an attitude of love and compassion. This is the essence of the “aloha” spirit that is sacred to the people of Hawaii.</p>
                            <h5 class="mt-3 mb-3">People often say “I’ve never had a massage like it”</h5>
                            <p>Before the session, Bec your therapist will consult with you about the current state of your physical, mental and emotional health. This assists both you and Bec in deciding on the treatment focus for the session. It’s important to set an intention before your session.</p>
                            <p>For long standing problems, it’s recommended to have at least 3 sessions in the first 6 weeks of therapy. Long standing problems often cannot be fixed in 1 session. Sometimes long standing problems also take a “habit” or “mindset” change to heal….</p>
                            <p>We should all be having body work once a month as an ongoing maintenance program, but with today’s busy lifestyle and financial pressures, this may seem impossible. However, Health really is the new Wealth. When you invest in your health, it gives you a great foundation for longevity and vibrant energy!</p>
                            <p>During the massage, it helps to focus on your breath. Each inhalation offers a chance to draw fresh energy and inspiration into the body and mind. Each exhalation, an opportunity to dissolve tension, to let go of anything that limits you and to deepen the experience of relaxation. If you experience discomfort or would like to express a particular need, feel free to communicate with your therapist at any stage during the massage. It’s important to drink plenty of water after a massage as this assists the detoxification process.</p>
                            <h5 class="mt-3 mb-3">Kahuna Body work is a powerful form of healing</h5> that affects people differently. In the days following a massage, you may experience muscle soreness, stiffness; especially if you have not had any body work for some time. You might experience a range of emotions as various energies are still shifting. There’s no need to worry. Simply observe your emotions without getting caught up in them and let them flow. The healing/cleansing effects and re-balancing of your body and mind can be felt for weeks after the treatment. Having a warm Epsom Salts bath after your treatment can help with muscle soreness.</p>
                            <p>Blending crystals and energy healing with the Kahuna body work helps to accentuate the healing experience.</p>

                            <h3>What is Access Consciousness Bars?</h3>
                            <h5 class="mt-3 mb-3"> Continued..</h5>
                            <p>Basically “the Bars” are the hard drive of your computer bank. The Access Bars ® are 32 points (16 on either side) on the head that when lightly touched start to clear all the limitations you have about different areas of your life and body. By running energy through these points we are dissipating the electromagnetic disturbance that is affecting YOUR BODY and YOUR LIFE! Releasing stuck energy is like deleting old files off your computer.</p>
                            <h5 class="mt-3 mb-3">Bars can be used to facilitate change in all areas of your life and health.</h5> When you are willing to function from more consciousness you begin to open the doors to all healing. Science tells us that the shape of the cells actually become more elliptical when they are influenced by thoughts, feelings and emotions which is the first step to dis-ease. When you get your bars “run” it unlocks this impact on the cells allowing the cells to return to their more spherical shape facilitating more ease in the body.</p>
                            <p>This is a nurturing body process that can help with greater mental clarity, motivation, significant increase in joy & happiness and deeper relaxation. It helps to release patterns that don't belong to you. Patterns picked up from parents, school, teachers, society. Having your Bars Run regularly on a weekly or monthly basis, helps you live a life as your authentic self without the patterning of the past running your mind. Feeling foggy, unclear?  Do you suffer from “busy mind” Do you find it difficult to be present, are you constantly in your head thinking of the next thing you need to do? Live a life as your authentic self. Release negative imprinting, live a happier, more joyful life. Need to defrag your brain? Get your Bars Run!</p>
                            <p>This nurturing process is a passive process on your behalf. You just lie on Bec’s therapy table fully clothed and covered. Bec will lightly touch the points on your head and you relax. </p>
                            <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3">Many people in their first session fall asleep and wake up refreshed and feeling “reset”.</h5>

                            <h6 class="mt-3 mb-1">Gaynor after her first session:</h6>

                            <p>"I just feel clearer and more in tune with my thoughts. Feeling blessed and grateful. I am definitely going to book another Access Bars ® with you."</p>
