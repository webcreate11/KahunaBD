                <h1 class="display-4 mb-3">My Story</h1>
                <p>Bec Davis has a background of extensive experience as a hospital trained Registered Nurse, Registered Psychiatric Nurse and Palliative Care both a Clinical Nurse Consultant and Clinical Nurse, working in community looking after people in their own homes while undergoing Palliative Care and Cancer Treatment. In 1992 she completed Reiki 1 and 2 Certificates.</p>
                <p>She has worked in the largest hospitals in Adelaide, South Australia, moving to the Sunshine Coast, she worked for the Blue Nurses and most recently for Blue Care.</p>
                <p>Wanting to help people has been a calling in her life since she was a young child. She discovered her “hot hands” at a young age, realising she was able to give people comfort from pain just by laying her hands on them.</p>
                <p>She used this gift in her role in Palliative Care when patients found that their Morphine was not holding their pain and Bec’s “hot hands” were able to bring some comfort and release for her patients.</p>
                <p>In 1992, she met Robert Morningsky (a Hopi Native American Indian) and went with him and a group of Australians to Arizona to complete an Indian Vision Quest. There Robert gave her the Indian name “Woman who walks far in search of Truth”. His parting words to her were “Pursue your Passion”</p>
                <p>Bec moved to the United States and lived there from 1992 to 1993 where she met Larry Littlebird, a Pueblo Indian who taught her many things about his culture. She assisted him along with her husband at the time on a story telling conference where the elders blessed her unborn son while he was still in the womb.</p>
                <p>In 2014, drawn again to native wisdom, Bec went to the Amazon Jungle in Peru with her son (then 21) and spent 2 weeks with the Shipibo Elders and Plant Medicine Healers to learn about plant medicine.</p>
                <p>She returned to her Sunshine Coast home and began setting up her own home garden, growing food organically, and growing many medicinal plants. She shared her organic gardening journey at mygarden2yours.com and on her Instagram and Facebook @mygarden2yours. Both of these are where her passion for a different life began.</p>
                <p>Bec has used her healing gift throughout her life in service in the Medical Profession and in her personal life, assisting friends with “hands on” and “distant healing”.</p>
                <p>Bec completed a Theta Healing Course in April of 2017. Theta Healing is the term used to describe an alternative therapy based on a healing technique that allows you to reach a level of consciousness which lets you to instantly change your emotional, mental, spiritual or physical reality.</p>
                <p>
                In December of 2017, for her birthday, by a series of synchronistic events, Bec went to Tivoli Retreat with a friend for a 4 day rejuvenation package. There she received her first Kahuna Massage (also known as Ka Huna Body Work). The session was ON her birthday and she had already been working on issues that were holding her back in her life and letting go of that which did not serve her. The Kahuna Massage facilitated the final and complete release of many issues she had been working on and she came away knowing which modality would combine perfectly with her gift of hands on energy healing. She completed her Kahuna Massage training in April 2018. Ka Huna Massage came naturally to Bec. It combines so well with her gifts of compassion, empathy and love for other souls.</p>
                <p>Bec spent some time away from alternate therapy practice as she raised her son as a single mother working full time across a few different industries. She came back to working in complimentary therapies in 2012 and built a private practice with a small client base.</p>
                <p>Bec provides services in all modalities and Combination Services too.</p>
                <p>Bec brings with her over 2 decades of knowledge of the human body, illness and disease and a gentle tranquil nature which she puts into her treatments. Bec is available to serve you with treatments in:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Kahuna Massage</li> 
                        <li>Hot Stone Massage</li>
                        <li>Access Consciousness Bars</li>
                        <li>Access Body Process</li> 
                        <li>Theta Healing</li>
                        <li>Reiki</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>She uses a combination of therapies in her Kahuna Massage treatments if she perceives they are required. Eg, She will pause and apply Reiki hands or Access Body Processes or Access Tools during treatments.</p>
                <p>“I view every being on my table as precious, I connect so I can treat your body with the care and consideration I would want to be treated with. I believe aloha (Hawaiian word for love) is the key ingredient in Kahuna Massage and therefore connection to you my client is essential to deliver a treatment that is just right for you today”</p>
                <p>Bec is dedicated to studying and increasing her knowledge, she completed many courses in 2018 with the motivation to provide a wider range of services in the Natural Therapy Arena. She is committed to her clients and her values. Bec is a passionate advocate to promote wellness and joy. She brings her many years of experience and knowledge to the table when her hands are working on her clients.

                <P>Bec combines her Energy Healing work “hot hands” with her many modalities to benefit the best outcome for her clients. Her years of experience as a Nurse, counselling people through illness and her worldly experience as a seeker, traveller and single Mum culminate in being able to assist and encourage her clients to heal themselves as she shares experiences from her own healing journey in a safe and relaxed atmosphere with her clients.</P>
